# Chrome-extension-messaging-template
This template is an example of how communication can work between the Chrome extension event page, the content script, and the page itself. 

## Techniques demonstrated include:
* Simple one-time requests
* Long-lived connections
* Script injection into the page
* Communication between the page and the content script using an event driven api
